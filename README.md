# Statistics_For_Business

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that performs structured statistical analysis for business-related datasets. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), hypothesis testing, and visualizations to uncover actionable insights for decision-making.

## Project Overview  
The goal of this project is to demonstrate the application of statistical techniques to solve real-world business problems. Through descriptive and inferential statistics, the analysis uncovers patterns, relationships, and insights that can guide business decisions.

## Features of the Project  

1. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Handling missing values and outliers to ensure the data is ready for analysis.

2. **Descriptive Statistics**  
   - Provides summaries of the data, including mean, median, and standard deviation for key business metrics.

3. **Data Visualizations**  
   - Utilizes clear and effective visualizations (e.g., histograms, bar charts, boxplots) to identify patterns and trends.

4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - In-depth analysis to explore relationships between features, like regions, customer segments, and product categories.

5. **Statistical Testing**  
   - Validates significant relationships in the data through hypothesis testing to support data-driven decision-making.

## Key Insights  

1. **Sales Performance by Region**  
   - The analysis shows regions with the highest sales, allowing businesses to focus on high-performing areas.  

2. **Customer Segment Analysis**  
   - Different customer segments were analyzed, revealing the segment with the largest contribution to total sales.  

3. **Sales Distribution**  
   - Sales data exhibits skewed patterns, with a concentration of smaller sales values but occasional high-value transactions.  

4. **Category and Sub-Category Analysis**  
   - Specific categories and sub-categories contributing the most to sales were identified, providing focus areas for product performance improvement.

5. **Outlier Detection**  
   - High-value sales outliers were detected, which may indicate significant business opportunities or unusual transactions.  

6. **Sales Trends Over Time**  
   - Sales trends showed seasonal or periodic variations, highlighting potential areas for targeted campaigns during peak periods.
